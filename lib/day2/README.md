# Day 2: Variables and Data Types 
Today, I learned about variables and data types in Dart. Here are some example programs:

- \ `lib/day2/variables.dart\`: Demonstrates variable declaratrion and usage.  
- \ `lib/day2/data_types.dart\`: Shows diffrent data types in Dart and how to use them.
Stay tuned for more updates!
