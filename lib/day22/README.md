Today, I learned about the Dart Nexted Collections

- `Hierarchical Data Representation`: Nexted collections can represent hierarchical structures like organizational charts, file systems, and more.

- `Complex Data Structures`: Nexted collections allow for commplex data structures, such as graph and trees.

- `Data Grouping`: Group related data for easier access and manipulation.

- Nexted collections in Dart provide a flexible way to manage complex and hierarchical data structures, enabling more sophisticated data manipulation and organization.
