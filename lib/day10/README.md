Today, I learned the Dart `for loop` 

- A `for` loop repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true.

- The loop consists of three parts: `initialization` `condition` and `increment`.

- Nested for loops can be used to handle more complex data structures.

- `for` loops are useful when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
