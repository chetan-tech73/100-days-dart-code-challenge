Today, I learned about the Dart Absract class.

WHEN TO USE ABSTRACT CLASS:

- when you have agroup of related classes that need to share some common behavior but also require their
own specific implementations'.

- when you want to define a common interface for a set of subclasses and ensure that certain methods are always implemented.
