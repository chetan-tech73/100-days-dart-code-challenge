Today, I learned about Flutter.

flutter is a toolkit developed by google, used for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop
from a single codebase,. it uses the Dart programming language and provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets for building responsive UIs. 

`Key Features of Flutter`:

- `Hot Reload:` You can instantly see the changes made to your app's UI without restarting it.

- `Cross-platform:` write once, deploy on iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop platforms.

- `Beautiful UIs:` Comes with a rich set of customizable widgets for building complex UIs.

- `Fast Performance:` Flutter's architecture compiles to native machine code,making apps performant.
