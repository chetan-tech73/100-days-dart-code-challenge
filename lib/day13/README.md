# dart_100_days_code_challenge

Today, I learned about the `List` type of collection in dart.

- Lists are ordered collections of elements and can store any data type.

- you can create lists using the `List` constructor or list literals.

- Access elements by index, modify elements, ad perform various operations such as adding, removing,
    and sorting elements.
