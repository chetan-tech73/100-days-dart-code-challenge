Today, I learned about the Dart Polymorphism.

In Dart, polymorphism is primarily achieved through method overriding and interfaces. 
the key idea is that a subclass can override methods of the superclass, allowing the 
method to behave differently depending on the type of the object that is calling it.

`polymorphism` concept is particularly powerful when working with collections of objects.
