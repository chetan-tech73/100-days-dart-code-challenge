Today, I learned the DART Control flow, specifically focusing on `switch`statement.

- `switch` evaluates an expression and matches it to one of the specified `case` values.

- `break` is necessary to exit the switch statement after executing the corresponding code block.

- `default` is optional and runs if no cases match the expression.
