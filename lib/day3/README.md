Today, I learned about Strings in Dart and its operation. here are some example programs:

- \ `lib/day3/String_type\` : shows the types of stings in dart (double and single quote string).
- \ `lib/day3/String_inteerpolation\` : shows how to embed expressions inside string using `${}`.
- \ `lib/day3/String_concatenation\` : dispays how to add Strings together using `+`.
