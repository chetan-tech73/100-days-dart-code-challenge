Today, I learned about the Dart Static methods and properties.

- `Static properties`: shared across all instances and accessed using the class name.
- `Static methods`: Utility functions that don't depend on instance varriables or methods, accesed using the class name.
- Static methods and properties can not directly access instance variables or methods.
