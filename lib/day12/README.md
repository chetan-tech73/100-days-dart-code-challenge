# dart_100_days_code_challenge

Today, I learned about the `do-while` loop in dart.

- A `d-while` loop guarantees that the code runs at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

- The condition is evaluated after the code block has executed.

- useful for scenarios where at least one execution of loop is neccesary, such as user input validation.
