# dart_100_days_code_challenge

Today, I learned about the Dart Advanced list and operations.

- `sorting` use the sort method, optionally with a custom comparator.

- `filtering` use the `where` method to filter elements based on a condition.

- `mapping` use the map to transform elements.

- `combining operations` chain methods like `where`, `map`, and `sort` for complex operations.

- `Reducing` use reduce and fold to combine elements into a single value.

- `other method` use `forEach` `any`, `every`, and fold for various list operations.
