Today, I learned about the Dart Class. 
`class` is a blueprint for creating objects. an object is an instance of a class.
- `class`: Blueprint for objects.
- `object`: instance of a class.
- `properties`: varriables inside a class.
- `methods`: functins inside a class.
-`constructors`: special method for initializing objects.
