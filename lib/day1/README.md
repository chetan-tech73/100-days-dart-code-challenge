#dart_100_days_code_challenge

Today, I learned about the Dart ecosystem and basic syntax. Here are some examples programs:

- hello.dart: prints "Hello, Day 1!".
- variables.dart: Demonstrates variables declearation and usage.
- functions.dart: shows how to create and call functions.
- control_flow.dart: contains an example of loops.
- classes: introduces object oriented programming (OOP) with a simple class example.
