Today, I learned about the Dart Mixins

`Mixins` are used for sharing code between classes that don't share a common ancestor.

- they are decleared using the keyword `mixin` and added toclasses using `with` keyword.

- `mixins` allows multiple classes to share methods without requiring them to be in the same inheritrance hierarchy.
