Today, I learned about the Dart Stream.

- `Streams` in dart represents a sequence of asynchronous events. its a way to handle data that comes in over time,
rather than all at once, the stream tells you that there is an event when it is ready.

- `Event` can either be a data event, an error event, or a done event.
