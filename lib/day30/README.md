Today, I learned about the Dart Getters and Setters

- `getters and setters` allows me to hide the internal state of an object and expose only what is necessary.

- `setters` can include validation logic to ensure that the property values remain consistent and valid.

- `getters` can be used to create read-only properties that can be calculated or derived from other properties.
