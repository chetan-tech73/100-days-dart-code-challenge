Today, I learned about the Dart Class Inheritance.

- `inheritance`: allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

- `subclass`: the class that inherits (child class).

- `super class`: the class being inherited from (parent class).

- `overriding`: Subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method defined in the super class.

- `super class`: used to call superclass methods and constructors.
