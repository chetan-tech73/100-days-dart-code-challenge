Today, I learned about the Dart Closure, Arrow function and anonymous function.

- `Anonymous` functions are defined without a name and are often used as arguments to other functions.

- `Arrow` function is a concise syntax for writting functions with a single expression. the expression value is returned automatically.

- `Closure` captures and use variables from their surrounding scope.
