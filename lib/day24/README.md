Today, I learned about the Dart Constructors. 

- `Basic` constructor initializes properties using parameters

- `Named` constructor provides multiple ways to create objects with specific initializations.

- `Redirecting` constructor calls another constructor in the same class.

- `Constant` constructor ensures immutability and allows compile-time constants when all properties are final.
