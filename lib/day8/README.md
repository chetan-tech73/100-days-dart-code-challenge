Today, I learned the DART Control flow, specifically focusing on coditional statements like `if` `if else` & `else`

- The `if` statement executes a block of code if its condition is true.

- The `else` statement executes if none of the preceeding conditions are true.

- The `else if` statement allows for multiple conditions to be checked in sequence.

- conditions are checked from to to bottom, and once a true condition is found, the corresponding block of code executes, and the rest ignored.
